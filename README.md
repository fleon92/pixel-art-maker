## Welcome!

Hello all!

This was my final for the Intro to Programming nanodegree. Feel free to use in any way, shape or form.

## Instructions

To use, simply download this as a zip and open up "Index.html" in your preferred browser.

Once opened, you will see options for height & width. Adjusting these & hitting submit will populate a grid!

Once the grid exists, you may choose a color by clicking under "Pick a Color". You may use the Color Picker or you may replace the color values if you wish.

With your color selected, go ahead and click on any cell & you'll see that it changes color! To reset, click "Submit" again & you'll start with a clean slate.
